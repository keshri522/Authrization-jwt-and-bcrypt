# JWT-and-Brypt-authrization
# Node.js, Express.js, JWT, and bcrypt Authentication & Authorization

## Introduction

This repository demonstrates how to implement user authentication and authorization using Node.js, Express.js, JSON Web Tokens (JWT), and bcrypt for password hashing.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript on the server-side.
- **Express.js**: A web application framework for Node.js that simplifies the process of building robust and scalable web applications.
- **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)**: A standard for securely transmitting information between parties. In this context, JWTs are used for user authentication.
- **bcrypt**: A password-hashing function that allows you to securely store and validate passwords.

## Project Structure

- `server.js`: The main entry point of the application.
- `routes/`: Contains route handlers for different parts of the API.
- `controllers/`: Handles the business logic of the application.
- `middlewares/`: Contains custom middleware functions for authentication and authorization.
- `models/`: Defines the data schema and interacts with the database.
- `config/`: Contains configuration files (e.g., database connection, JWT secret).

## Setup Instructions

1. Install dependencies:
  
2. Start the server:

3. Backend Deployment link

4. Main App Deploy Frontend.

## Authentication Flow

1. User registers with their email and password.
2. Password is hashed using bcrypt before being stored in the database.
3. Upon successful registration, a JWT token is generated.
4. User can use the JWT token for subsequent authenticated requests.

## Authorization Flow

1. Certain routes require authentication. They check the JWT token in the request headers.
2. If the token is valid, the user is allowed to access the route.
3. If the token is invalid or missing, the user is denied access.

## Endpoints

- `POST /signin`: Allows users to register with their email and password.
- `POST /signup`: Allows registered users to log in and receive a JWT token.
